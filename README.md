# Unsupervised K-Means Clustering
  ### Introduction
This dataset involves 62988 rows and 23 columns. The goal of this project is to segmentation of the data airline customers with the LRFMC indicators by performing K-Means clustering algorithm.
  ### The Steps
- Data understanding
- Data Processing and Analysis of the data
- Clustering and Visualization
- Conclusion

### Conclusion
The data of flight can be classified into 5 clusters with the LRFMC indicators and perform K-Means clustering algorithm which aims to make clustering each user easier.
